# Feature description cards for Firefox Accounts.

This directory is our
lightweight planning and tracking mechanism
for new feature development in Firefox Accounts.

Each sub-directory named "FxA-XX-YYY"
corresponds to a [feature card in aha](https://mozilla.aha.io/products/FXA/feature_cards)
and provides the details of
how the feature will look and behave,
how it will be implemented,
and how we'll determine whether it was successful.

The features in the top-level directory
are the ones being active worked on.
New incoming features
are in the "proposed" subdirectory,
while completed features
are under "shipped"
for historical reference.

Want to propose a new feature?
Open a PR adding its description
to the "proposed" directory,
and we can chat about it in the issue.

You can use the [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) and [TEMPLATE_CLEAN.md](TEMPLATE_CLEAN.md)
from this directory to quickly get started.
