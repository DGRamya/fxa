Choose What To Sync
======================

https://mozilla.aha.io/features/FXA-33

As a user, I want to choose what data types to sync as part
 of the account setup process, so that it's more obvious what
 functionality I'm signing up for.

## Choose what to sync view (compact)

## Choose what to sync view (long translations)

This design is suitable for languages that have long translations. 

The data types become a single column.
