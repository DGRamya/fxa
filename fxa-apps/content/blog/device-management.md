Today we are beginning a phased roll out of a new account management feature to Firefox Accounts users. This new feature aims to give users a clear overview of all services attached to the account, and provide our users with full control over their synced devices.

With the new “Devices” panel in your Firefox Accounts settings, you will be able to manage all your devices that use Firefox Sync. The devices section shows all connected Firefox clients on Desktop, iOS and Android, making it an excellent addition to those who use Firefox Sync on multiple devices. Use the “Disconnect” button to get rid of the devices that you don’t want to sync.
